Hello Everyone!! I am Amitabh Dey creating this repo 
<br>
So This Repo is going to be the main site of our Project
<br>
<h2> The Project name is "Healthlog</h2>
HealthLog is an experimental, privacy-first personal health & wellbeing tracker that focuses on patterns, not diagnoses.
<br>
This project:
<br>
Is not production-ready
<br>
Has incomplete features
<br>
Was paused due to scope, validation, and time constraints
<br>
However, the foundation exists, and the idea is open for:
<br>
Iteration
<br>
Learning
<br>
Feature experimentation
<br>
<br>
<h3>Portfolio-level contributions<br>
Version Control: Git & GitHub</h3>
<br>
<br>
HealthLog may not have reached its original vision — but it remains a valuable learning artifact.

If you find the idea interesting, feel free to explore, improve, or rebuild it in your own way.

Happy contributing 🚀
